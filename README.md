# li

This is a package used to generate licenses, to install it use: `npm i -g @devep/li`, this will enable the li alias on your system and you can use it to generate the following types of licenses: `mit`, `apache2`, `bsd2`, `bsd3`, `bsd4`, `gplv3` and `isc`.

To configure the owner of each of the licenses use: `li config-owner <owner>`, you can change this using the command again.

To generate the licenses use: `li gen <type> <license file?>`, it should be noted that if you do not specify the license file, it will be `LICENSE.md` by default.
